This is the root tool for the Toshiba Thrive 10.1" ICS IMM76D.01.000072314 OTA/Service Station.

If using this results in an unrecoverable bootloader error, visit thriveforums.org and request a reflash from pio_masaki.

If you have bootloops after running the rootme.bat/sh then run fixme.bat/sh to correct it. This will remove the temp root that causes the instability you are seeing, and will then clean up and remove the temp folder created by the rootme.bat/sh files.
